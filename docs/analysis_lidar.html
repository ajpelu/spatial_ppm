Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Our aim is to get the spatial stand structure around each of the
focal pine. Specifically, we want to explore the number of neighbors in
a 25-m radius plot, and also get the surface within this 25-m plot not
cover by trees. This no-covered tree area could be considered as an
indicator of the available habitat for the burial of caterpillars. For
each focal pine we will get this area, and then we could modelize the
number of clutches of processionary moths as a function of the available
habitat around each focal pine.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<div id="lidar-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>LIDAR processing</h3>
<p>We use the LIDAR data from PNOA. The steps followed to process the
data were (see this <a href="get_lidar.html">code</a> to more
detail):</p>
<ul>
<li>For each area (VC, CQ, LP), we get the LIDAR data (2ª Cobertura)
files (<code>.laz</code> format)</li>
<li>Compute the Digital Terrain Model from LIDAR data using a resolution
of 0.5 m (grid cell) and applying an invert distance weighting algorithm
(<a
href="https://r-lidar.github.io/lidRbook/dtm.html#idw">IDW</a>).<br />
</li>
<li>Normalization of the point cloud (normalized las data).</li>
<li>Clip the normalized data data using a cicular plot with a radius of
25 m around the focal pine.</li>
<li>Compute the Canopy Height Model (CHM), with a grid resolution of 0.5
m (grid cell). For each grid cell the height of the highest point is
computed. All the elevations are now relative to the ground surface. For
25-m buffer polygon around each focal pine, a file with the chm was
generated and saved as raster file (<code>chm.tiff</code> files).</li>
</ul>

<li>Using the CHM, compute the number of pixels above a specific
vertical threshold, <em>i.e.</em> surrogate to identify if a pixel could
be considered occupied by tree or shrubland (&gt; threshold). We used a
treshold of 50 cm (Yes, I know it could be subjectively, and target to
criticism). So all the pixels above this threshold could be considered
as available habitat for the burial of caterpillars.</li>

<h3>Some caveats</h3>
<p>Before continuing, we must point out some limitations of the use of
LIDAR and some errors derived from the processing and data collection in
the field.</p>
<p>The first one is the exact position of each tree. The position data
of each tree were recorded with a GPS device with an error that
introduce some bias in the data. See this example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>col &lt;- terrain.colors(25, rev = TRUE)
chm &lt;- rast(&quot;data/chm/vc/chm_smoothed_vc_32.tif&quot;)
plot(chm, col = col)
plot(sf::st_geometry(fpi), add = TRUE, pch = 21, col=&#39;black&#39;, bg=&quot;blue&quot;, cex = 1.5)
text(x = st_coordinates(fpi)[,1] + 2, 
     y = st_coordinates(fpi)[,2] + 2, 
     labels = fpi$number_pino)
plot(sf::st_geometry(b25), add = TRUE, pch = 19, border=&quot;blue&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/analysis_lidar.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see that the centroid of the focal pine does not correspond
with the centroid of the pine obtanied using the LIDAR data. So, this
error is propagated in different ways to the other pines (since the
position of each pine is captured using a GPS device).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pines &lt;- sf::st_intersection(b25, spatial_pine) |&gt; 
  filter(number_pino.1 != 32)

plot(chm, col = col)
plot(sf::st_geometry(fpi), add = TRUE, pch = 21, col=&#39;black&#39;, bg=&quot;blue&quot;, cex = 1.5)
text(x = st_coordinates(fpi)[,1] + 2, 
     y = st_coordinates(fpi)[,2] + 2, 
     labels = fpi$number_pino)
plot(sf::st_geometry(b25), add = TRUE, pch = 19, border=&quot;blue&quot;)
plot(sf::st_geometry(pines), add = TRUE, pch = 4, col=&#39;black&#39;, cex =1.2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="figure/analysis_lidar.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Another bias could be derivated of the threshold considered to
estimate the % of available soil.</p>
